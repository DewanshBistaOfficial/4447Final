###### Faiza Ali, Logan Han, Dewansh Bista

Problem Definition/Research Question:

How does new and emerging AI technology impact different job industries?

Real-world Impact:

As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to evolve, it is crucial to understand its influence on the job market. 
AI has begun to play a significant role in various industries across the country, from automation in manufacturing 
to AI-driven decision making in marketing and finance. While certain jobs are at risk of being replaced by AI, others 
are transforming and requiring workers to adapt and upskill. This project aims to provide a data-driven analysis of 
how AI is affecting different job industries and its impact on the current workforce.

AI-driven automation also raises concerns about job displacement and growing inequality in the workforce. As AI takes over 
routine and manual tasks, lower skilled workers are at a higher risk of losing employment opportunities, while highly skilled 
workers benefit from AI-enhanced roles. This shift can widen economic gaps, making it difficult for certain individuals to find 
stable, well-paying jobs. Understanding these trends and disparities is essential for government policymakers, businesses, 
corporations, and workers alike, as it allows for developing strategies that promote workforce adaptability and ensuring 
that AI advancements create opportunities rather than deepen inequalities.

Dataset Description:

For this study, we will be utilizing two different data sets for this project:
- From Data Entry to CEO: The AI Job Threat Index - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manavgupta92/from-data-entry-to-ceo-the-ai-job-threat-index
- LinkedIn Job Postings (2023 - 2024) - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshkon/linkedin-job-postings

Both datasets were compiled and made publicly avilable on Kaggle and requires no additional data collection.
